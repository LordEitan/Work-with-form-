Interesting examples how a form can be a filter and can sava name after submit
Feature form #1, it's filter which you need choose city and after you will see only one city which you chosen
Feature form #2, this is a simple input line but when you will write some name and after you will submit, you will see that name will save in input line 
Feature form #3, this is a multiselect form, it's mean that when you will choose one from 4 classifications, after you will see only one which you chosen
